# Hackathon - Wild Blueberry Yield Prediction (Kaggle Competition)

# ![banner](./assets/Banner.jpg)

## Problem Statement

A [Kaggle competition data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/wild-blueberry-yield-prediction-dataset) was held to create a predictive model for wild blueberry "crop" yield based on factors/variables such as the amount of rain, temperature, number of bees, etc.

## Executive Summary

Using [Kaggle competition data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/wild-blueberry-yield-prediction-dataset), 

A number of machine learning models (and the weights of variables) were evaluated, including: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagged Decision Trees, GradientBoost, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and K Nearest Neighbors.  Models were optimized using primarily RandomSearch, but GridSearch is used selectively (for comparison purposes) as well.  Top performing models were ensembled using Voting Regressor to produce a final predictive model.

The PyCaret library is also demonstrated, which offers "single-line" evaluation of many different regressors.

Predictionf from both the self-ensembled model and the PyCaret model were submitted to Kaggle.
